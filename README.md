# IDontCare
A mod for Mount&amp;Blade 2: Bannerlord that modifies campaign logs to not display info that's completely useless for the player

Uses Harmony to patch into log entry creation process at the very last step just before being displayed to player. There, using MCM menu and filtering classes - determines which logs should be visible to the player (should he care about them). The entries are just not displayed, they're still saved into game's internal wiki-database so no information is being lost. It's merely a QoL mod.
