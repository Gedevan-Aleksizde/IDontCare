A mod for Mount&amp;Blade 2: Bannerlord that modifies campaign logs to not display info that's completely useless for the player


Currently it should work in two ways:

- Blocking by log factions - Mod checks what factions are involved in the action (e.g.: raiding a village), then checks if any of those factions are allied or enemies to the player. If yes, then log is displayed. Otherwise it is not.
- Blocking by importance - This setting uses game's system of log importance and might not really resemble how important player finds them.
